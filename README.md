The object of this project is to create multiple agents communicating amongst themselves.
Each agent is containerised into docker and the agents will be organised and controlled within the Kubernetes framework.
There may or may not be a configuration to control which agents are to be used in a task/project. It might be the case that they work out amongst themselves which they should use.
